# google-fonts-webpack-plugin
Add Google Fonts via CDN to HTMLWebpackPlugin, or download the fonts and use locally.


## Installation
Install the plugin with `npm`:
```sh 
$ npm i google-fonts-webpack-plugin -D 
```

NOTE: This plugin requires `html-webpack-plugin@^2.10.0`.

## Basic Usage

This plugin will add the given Google fonts to the html generated by `html-webpack-plugin`. Add an array of font names and the options for them into webpack using this plugin and they can be injected into the generated HTML via the Google CDN or locally served.

```js
var HTMLWebpackPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin');
var GoogleFontsWebpackPlugin = require('google-fonts-webpack-plugin');

...

module.exports = {
    entry: 'index.js',
    output: {
        path: 'dist',
        filename: 'bundle.js'
    },
    plugins: [
        new HtmlWebpackPlugin(),
        new GoogleFontsWebpackPlugin({
            fonts: [
                { "Open Sans": "300,700" }
            ]
        })
    ]
}

```

This will add a link tag to the HTML generated by `html-webpack-plugin`, and look like this:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <title>Sample App</title>
        <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:300,700" rel="stylesheet"/>
    </head>
    <body>
        ...
    </body>
</html>
```

## Options 
Options are passed to the plugin during instantiation.

```js
new GoogleFontsWebpackPlugin({
    fonts: [
        { "Open Sans": "300,700" }
    ]
})
```

#### `fonts`
Type: `JSON Object`, mandatory

An array of JSON objects for each font you wish to include in the webpack.

#### `ssl`
Type: `boolean`, default: `true`

If `true`, it will use https for the googleapis URL.
